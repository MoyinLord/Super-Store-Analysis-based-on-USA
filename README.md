#          Project-brief
Design your own Super Store dashboard for a country of your choice
Now that you have the skill to create quick dashboards on Tableau. Let’s design
dashboard only applicable to a country of your choice.
It will be beneficial for you to choose a country which already has substantial Super Store.
It will also be great for your own learning to build this dashboard new, from scratch. So,
start a new workbook on Tableau and connect to the data source!
Requirements:
1. Connect to the official Tableau Super Store datasets.
2. Review the mock up dashboard on the next page. You will need to crate the
following:
# a. A headline card representing total sales of the country

# b. A bar chart representing Sales of each sub-category compare to profits

3. When you’re done with your dashboard click on “Server” and publish to Tableau
Public or github repository.

4. Upload a screenshot of your dashboard and a link to your Tableau Public
dashboard so everyone taking the course can see your work!
